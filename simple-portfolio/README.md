# Portfolio Site

This is an example portfolio site created as a part of my front-end bootcamp assignment. The site showcases my skills, projects, and provides a glimpse into my journey as a web developer.

## Project 1

The first project which will you find in the "Work" section of the website is the **_Nike_** website which I built using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

This is a sports brand that I worked with on this project to get there site exactly how they required in order to make it simple for there customer base to shop and browse there extensive list of products and sporting equipment.

## Project 2

The second project which I worked on and built was thr **_Adidas_** website which I built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.

This is another sports branded webite that I worked with in order to reach there goals of having a fully functional website in which there customers could locate there nearest stores, check stock, purchase clothing and also send in any complains/queries regarding there orders.

The last two projects on my portfolio are both a mix of the first two (Nike and Adidas) which where also built using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

Both websites are again sporting brands which customers can purchase sports related equipment and clothing from.
